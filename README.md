# TicTacToe

Thank you for visiting :)

# Project Overview

This project is a simple Windows Forms application that enables users to play Tic Tac Toe, either against another player locally on the same computer or against a computer opponent. The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for players of all ages to engage in this classic game.

The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid, and players can click on the squares to place their X or O markers. The application includes real-time validation to prevent players from making illegal moves, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience. Once a player wins, or if the game ends in a draw, a message box displays the outcome, along with an option to restart the game.

# What to Expect

Projects like this was an integral part of my learnings in software development in general. This repository captures an important phase in my journey as a software developer. So you can expect the following:

### Code Quality:
The code here is a testament to my early programming skills. You may encounter numerous bugs, terrible inefficiencies, and less-than-ideal coding practices that were part of my learning curve.

### Learning Journey:
This project was more about the journey than the destination. It helped me understand the basics of software development and laid the foundation for the skills I have today.

### Nostalgia:
While this project may no longer be relevant, it’s a personal reminder of where I began. It’s a piece of my history that I keep as a benchmark of my progress as a software developer.

# Why This Project is Archived
This project is in an archived state and is no longer being actively maintained or updated. I’ve chosen to preserve it in its original form as a record of my growth as a developer. It’s a snapshot of a time when I was still finding my footing in the world of coding.

# Final Thoughts
I hope you find value in exploring this codebase, even if it’s just to see how far one can come from humble beginnings. And if you don't find value in this project I hope it brings a smile to your face as you find many.... many.... cringe worthy practices.

This project may be frozen in time, but the lessons I learned from it continue to influence my work today.
