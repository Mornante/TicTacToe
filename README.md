# Welcome

This is Yet another University Project :)

Yes the code in this repository is awful and the project does not provide much value

**BUT**

I love to keep these types of project around to remind myself where I started in my early days of learning to code and how I have grown as a developer since. They inspire me to become even better in the future and allow me to look back at these old types of projects and say **why did I not just do this instead**.

I hope you enjoy reviewing this codebase, finding bugs, duplicate code and all round bad practices as I have enjoyed building this project back in the day.
